# Parkinson Disease Detection using KNN and Making WebApp through Heroku
- This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD). Each column in the table is a particular voice measure, and each row corresponds one of 195 voice recording from these individuals ("name" column). The main aim of the data is to discriminate healthy people from those with PD, according to "status" column which is set to 0 for healthy and 1 for PD.

- I used *pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, xgboost, scipy, and sklearn libraries* to do *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualzation, Data Cleaning/Filtering, and Building Models*

- I made *Logistic Regression Model, Decision Tree Model, Random Forest Classifier Model, Bagging Model, Boosting Model, XGBoost Model, SVM (Support Vector Machine) Model, and KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors) Model*. Among this *KNN Model shows highest accuracy i.e. 92% with AUC score of 0.98.*

- Report: I also made a report on this project which contains all information related to Parkinson's Disease and the details of all algorithms, libraries, and models which I used.
